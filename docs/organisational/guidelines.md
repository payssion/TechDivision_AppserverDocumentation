# Guidelines

## Coding Styles

We want to provide good open source code quality. Therefore weÂ´ve implemented specific coding guidelines which are compulsive for all the code within the appserver.io project.

Our coding guidelines are based on the [PSR-2](<https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md>) standard and various [PEAR DocBlock](<http://pear.php.net/manual/en/standards.header.php>) ideas.

You can find further useful information about PSR-2 at the project page.
